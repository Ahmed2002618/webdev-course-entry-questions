# Webdev Course Entry Questions

Coding questions for the mentor entry form to the schulich ignite webdev course

## Steps

Each document will have a comment at the top with what you need to do and there is a folder called `answer_images` with images of what an answer should look like. You **do not have to answer them all or any if you don't want to**.

Each will have a header that looks like this:

```html
<!--For this file please ensure it matches the output image /answer_image/challenge_<number>.png

Name:
-->
```

If you have attempted the question please put your name after `Name:`, if not then leave this blank. To see the correct output and how it should look take the name of the file and find the corresponding image (i.e. for `challenge_1.html` look for `/answer_image/challenge_1.png`), if your file looks like this in a **chromium browser** (chrome, edge or any derivatives [sorry firefox users]) then it is considered correct.

For the `owl.md` file please fill out `owl.html` with equivalent HTML to match the markdown.
